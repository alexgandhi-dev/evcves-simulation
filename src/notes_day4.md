# Day 4 - Signal Filtering

## What Filtering Does
Filtering reduces short-term variability while preserving longer-term structure in the signal.

## Tradeoff Observed
As the window size increases, noise decreases but important physiological features can be flattened or delayed

## EVCVES Relevance
In EVCVES, filtering must balance noise suppression with preserving clinically meaningful dynamics so real pathology is not masked.
