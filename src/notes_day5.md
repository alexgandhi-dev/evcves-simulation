# Day 5 - Evaluating Filtering Tradeoffs

## What Distortion Represents
Distortion measures how much filtering changes the original signal rather than just removing noise.

## Key Tradeoff Observed
Stronger filtering reduces noise but increases distortion, meaning real signal features may be altered or delayed

## EVCVES Implication
In EVCVES, excessive filtering could hide transient cardiac events, while insufficient filtering could produce misleading artifacts.

## Reviewer Question
What level of distortion is acceptable depends on clinical context and what features the clinician needs to detect.
