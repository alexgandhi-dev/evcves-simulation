# Day 3 – Signal Visualization & Interpretation

## Noise Observation
As noise increases, the underlying sinusoidal signal becomes harder to visually interpret even though the core rhythmic pattern remains the same.

## Time Resolution Observation
With fewer time points, the signal appears less smooth and important structure can be lost, while higher time resolution preserves the underlying pattern but can amplify visible noise.

## EVCVES Mapping

- Noise in this simulation could represent perfusion instability, imaging artifacts, sensor noise, or turbulence introduced by cannula positioning.
- Time resolution could represent camera frame rate, sampling frequency of pressure/flow sensors, or temporal resolution of imaging hardware.
- A surgeon would care about distinguishing these signals to determine whether irregular patterns reflect true cardiac behavior or artifacts introduced by the system itself.
